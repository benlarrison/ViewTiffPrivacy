            View Tiff uses the TrueDepth API exclusively to collect facial data points necessary for enabling real-time camera filters and effects like emojis, glasses, and duck mode. This data is processed entirely on your device and is not stored, transmitted, or shared with any third parties. The facial data remains under the sole ownership of the user and is used solely to provide the intended functionality of the app.
